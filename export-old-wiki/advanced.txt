This part presents some aspects that you face when you deploy Seaside applications for real. It presents how to configure and deploy an application.While Seaside keeps as much state on the server side as possible, it supports the creation and integration of REST web services as well. This part covers how to write a REST API and integrate it with an existing application.Although Seaside does not offer a built-in persistency framework, the issue of how to manage your data is a common concern when building web applications. This part also covers a selection of approaches to managing data persistency in Smalltalk, and how these work with Seaside. Finally, we present Magritte, which is a metadata framework with Seaside integration: using Magritte allows you to generate forms on the fly without hard-coding HTML or generating XML files.
