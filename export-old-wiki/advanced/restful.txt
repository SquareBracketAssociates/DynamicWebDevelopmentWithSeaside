+index:REST+ Seaside is not built around REST services by default, to increase programmer productivity and make to development much more fun. In some cases, it might be necessary to provide a REST API to increase the usability and interoperability of a web application though. Luckily Seaside provides a ''Seaside REST'' package to fill the gap and to allow one to mix both approaches.In this chapter, we show how to integrate web applications with Seaside REST services. We start with a short presentation of REST. Then we define a simple REST service for the todo application we implemented in *ref:../../in-action/todo*. We finish this chapter by inspecting how HTTP requests and responses work. We want to thank Olivier Auverlot for providing us with an initial draft of this chapter in French.
