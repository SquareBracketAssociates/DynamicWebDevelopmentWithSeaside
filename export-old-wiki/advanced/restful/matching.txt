In the initial example we have seen how to define a service that catches all GET requests to the handler. In the following sections we will look at defining more complicated services using more elaborate patterns. In *ref:http-method* we are going to look at matching other request types, such as POST and PUT. In *ref:content-type* we are going to see how to serve different content types depending on the requested data. In *ref:request-path* we will see how to match path elements and in *ref:query-parameters* how to extract query parameters.
