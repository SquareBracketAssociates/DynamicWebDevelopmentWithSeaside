To get started load the package ==Seaside-Rest-Core==, and if you are on Pharo ==Seaside-Pharo-Rest-Core==. All packages are available from the ==Seaside30Addons== repository and you can load then easily with the following Gofer script:==Gofer new==  squeaksource: 'Seaside30Addons';==  package: 'Seaside-REST-Core';==  package: 'Seaside-Pharo-REST-Core';==  package: 'Seaside-Tests-REST-Core';==  load.Recent Seaside images already contain the REST packages preloaded.
