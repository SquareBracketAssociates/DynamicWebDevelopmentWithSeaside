Sometimes there are several methods which Seaside-REST could choose for a request, here's how it finds the "best" one:# Exact path matches like ==/index.html== take precedence over partial ==/index.{var}== or =={var}.html== or wildcard ones =={var}==.# Partial path matches like ==/index.{var}== or =={var}.html== take precedence over wildcard ones =={var}==.# Partial single element matches =={var}== take precedence over multi element matches ==\*var\*==.# Exact mime type matches like ==text/xml== take precedence over partial ==\*/xml== or ==xml/\*==, wildcard ==\*/\*== and missing ones.# Partial mime type matches like ==\*/xml== or ==xml/\*== take precedence over wildcard ones ==\*/\*== or missing ones.# If the user agent supplies quality values for the Accept header, then that is taken into account as well.
