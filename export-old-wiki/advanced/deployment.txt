At some point you certainly want to go public with your web application. This means you need to find a server that is publicly reachable and that can host your Seaside application. If your application is successful, you might need to scale it to handle thousands of concurrent users. All this requires some technical knowledge. In *ref:deployment-preparing* we are going to have a look at some best practices before deploying an application. Then in *ref:deployment-seasidehosting* we introduce Seaside-Hosting, a simple and free hosting service for non-commercial Seaside applications. Next, in *ref:deployment-apache* we present how to setup your own server using Apache. Last but not least, in *ref:maintaining*, we demonstrate ways to maintain a deployed image.
