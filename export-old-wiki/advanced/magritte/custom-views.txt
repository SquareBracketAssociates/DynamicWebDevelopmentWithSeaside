Components control how your objects display. Some  descriptions have an obvious one to one relationship with a UI component while others could easily be shown by several different components. *ref:views* shows some components. For example, an ==MAMemoDescription== would be represented by a text area, but a ==MABooleanDescription== could be a checkbox, or a drop down with true and false, or a radio group with true and false.  Each description defaults to a component, but allows you to override and specify any component you  choose, including any custom one you may write using the message +index:componentClass:!componentClass:+ ==Description>>componentClass:==. ==aDescription componentClass: aClass+views|width=70%+You can also define your own view by following the steps: - Create a subclass of ==MADescriptionComponent==.- Override ==renderEditorOn:== and/or ==renderViewerOn:== as necessary.- Use your custom view together with your description by using the accessor ==componentClass:==. - Possibly add your custom view to its description into ==defaultComponentClasses==.
