While Magritte is really powerful, using a meta-data system will add another indirection layer to your application, so this is important to understand how to use such power and when to just use normal development techniques. A good and small example to learn from is the Conrad conference management system developed to manage the ESUG conference available at *http://www.squeaksource.com/Conrad.html*. Here Magritte is used to describe the different forms and all the data. The Pier content management system is a more complex example of using Magritte, it can be downloaded at *http://www.piercms.com*.
