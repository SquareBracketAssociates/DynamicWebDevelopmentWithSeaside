Depending on the Smalltalk dialect you are using, the installation of the VM is different. Installing Squeak on a Debian system is simple. Install Squeak by entering the following command on the terminal: =$ sudo apt-get install squeak-vmNote that installing and running Squeak does not require you to have the ''X Window System'' installed. Just tell the installer not to pull these dependencies in, when you are asked for it. Squeak remains runnable headless without a user-interface, this is what you want to do on most servers anyway. Up-to-date information on the status of the Squeak VM you find at *http://www.squeakvm.org/unix/*.Now you should be able to start the VM. Typing the ==squeak== command executes a helper script that allows one to install new images and sources in the current directory, and run the VM. The VM itself can be started using the ==squeakvm== command.=$ squeakvm -help=$ squeakvm -vm-display-null imagename.imageYou can find additional help on starting the VM and the possible command line parameters in the man pages:=$ man squeakIn the next section we are going to look at how we can run the VM as a daemon.
