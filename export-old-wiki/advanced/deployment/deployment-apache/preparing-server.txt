Before getting started you need a server machine. This is a computer with a static IP address that is always connected to the Internet. It is not required that you have physical access to your machine. You might well decide to host your application on a virtual private server (VPS). It is important to note that you require superuser-level access to be able to run Smalltalk images. The ability to execute PHP scripts is not enough.We assume that your server already has a working Linux installation. In the following sections we use Debian Linux 5.0 (Lenny), however with minor adjustments you will also be able to deploy applications on other distributions. Before starting with the setup of your application, it is important to make sure that your server software is up-to-date. It is crucial that you always keep your server up to the latest version to prevent malicious attacks and well-known bugs in the software. To update your server execute the following commands from a terminal. Most commands we use in this chapter require administrative privileges, therefore we prepend them with sudo (super user do):=$ sudo apt-get update=$ sudo apt-get upgrade=Reading package lists... Done=Building dependency tree... Done=0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
