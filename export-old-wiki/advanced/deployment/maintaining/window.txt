Instead of running the  VM headless as we did in *ref:/book/advanced/deployment/deployment-apache/run-vm*, it is also possible to run it headful as you do during development. This is common practice on Windows servers, but it is rarely done on Unix. Normally servers doesn't come with a windowing system for performance and security reasons. Managing a headful image is straightforward, so we will not be discussing this case further.
