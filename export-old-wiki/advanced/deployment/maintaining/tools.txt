Seaside comes with several tools included that help you with the management of deployed applications. The tools included with the Pharo distribution of Seaside includes:|{ Configuration | *http://localhost:8080/config* |{ System Status | *http://localhost:8080/status*|{ Class Browser | *http://localhost:8080/tools/classbrowser*|{ Screenshot | *http://localhost:8080/tools/screenshot*|{ Version Uploader | *http://localhost:8080/tools/versionuploader*""Configuration."" The Seaside configuration interface is described throughout this book, especially in the previous sections so we are not going to discuss this further.""System Status."" The System status is a tool that provides useful information on the system. It includes information on the image (see *ref:system-status.png*), the virtual machine, Seaside, the garbage collector and the running processes.+system-status.png|width=80%+""Class Browser."" The class browser provides access the source code of the system and allows you to edit any method or class while your application is running.""Screenshot."" The screenshot application provides a view into your image, even if it runs headless. Clicking on the screenshot even allows you to open menus and to interact with the tools within your deployed image.""Version Uploader."" The version uploader is a simple interface to Monticello. It allows you to check what code is loaded into the image and gives you the possibility to update the code on the fly.@@important If you plan to use any of these tools in a deployed image make sure that they are properly secured from unauthorized access. You don't want that any of your users accidentally stumble upon one of them and you don't want to give hackers the possibility to compromise your system.
