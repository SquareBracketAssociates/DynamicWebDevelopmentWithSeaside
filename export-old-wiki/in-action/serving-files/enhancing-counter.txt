We've gone on long enough without a working hands-on example. To illustrate how to use a file library, we will show how to add some resources to the WebCounter application we defined in the first chapter of this +index:WAFileLibrary+ book (*http://localhost:8080/webcounter*) or can also use the version that comes with Seaside (*http://localhost:8080/examples/counter*). First we create a new subclass of  ==WAFileLibrary== named ==CounterLibrary== as follows:==WAFileLibrary subclass: #CounterLibrary==    instanceVariableNames: ''==    classVariableNames: ''==    poolDictionaries: ''==    category: 'Test'+WACounterFileLibraryEmpty|width=70%++AddedCounterLibrary|width=70%+We will follow the steps presented in the previous section and associate two resources to our library. One is an icon named ==seaside.png== and the other is a CSS file named ==seaside.css== \-- you can download the ones from the Seaside website we mentioned before:; seaside.png: *http://www.seaside.st/styles/logo-plain.png* (rename once downloaded).; seaside.css: *http://seaside.st/styles/main.css* @@important Pay attention that the file name of your resources does not contain non-alphabetic characters since it may cause problems. Now we change the method ==renderContentOn:== \-- this shows how we access resources using the +index:urlOf:!urlOf:+ ==urlOf:==.==WebCounter>>renderContentOn: html==    html image url: (CounterLibrary urlOf: #seasidePng).==    html heading: count.==    html anchor==        callback: [ self increase ];==        with: '++'.==    html space.==    html anchor==        callback: [ self decrease ];==        with: '--'Next we implement +index:WAComponent!updateRoot:+ ==updateRoot:== so that our component contains a link to our style sheet:==WebCounter>>updateRoot: anHtmlRoot==   super updateRoot: anHtmlRoot.==   anHtmlRoot stylesheet url: (CounterLibrary urlOf: #seasideCss)This causes the look of our application to change. It now uses the CSS file we added to our file library as shown by *ref:counterNoCss*.+counterNoCss|width=20%+Have a look at the XHTML source generated by Seaside by using your browser's View Source option. You will see that the links are added to the head section of the HTML document as shown below:=...=<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/files/CounterLibrary.css"/>=</head>=<body onload="onLoad()" onkeydown="onKeyDown(event)">=  <img alt="" src="/files/CounterLibrary/seaside.png"/>=  <h1>0</h1>=  <a href="http://localhost:8080/WebCounter?_s=UwGcN6vwGVmj9icD&amp;_k=D6Daqxer&amp;1">++</a>&nbsp;=  <a href="http://localhost:8080/WebCounter?_s=UwGcN6vwGVmj9icD&amp;_k=D6Daqxer&amp;2">--</a>=...
