Since version 2.7, Seaside has included a library for serving files called ''FileLibrary''. This solution is handy for rapid application development and is suitable for deployed applications which only make use of a small number of small files. It has the advantage that all of the resources are contained in your Smalltalk image and can be versioned with your favorite Smalltalk version management tools. However this also means that these resources are ""not"" reachable where most of your operating system's tools are accustomed to find things.FileLibrary has the primary advantage that it is a portable way to serve static contents directly from Seaside without the need to setup a standalone web server. See *ref:/book/advanced/deployment* to read about Apache configuration for static file serving.
