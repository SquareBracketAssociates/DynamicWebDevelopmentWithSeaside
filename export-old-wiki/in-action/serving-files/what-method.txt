You have the following choices for serving static files with your Seaside application:- The default answer is pretty simple: if you don't know anything about web servers, use ==FileLibrary==. - If you want to have your static resources versioned inside your Smalltalk image and don't have too many (or too large) resources, use ==FileLibrary==. - If you prefer to keep your static resources on your file system where you can edit and version them with your favorite file-based tools but you don't want to run a separate web server, go read about how to serve static content from your image in *ref:/book/in-action/serving-files*. - Otherwise read *ref:/book/advanced/deployment/deployment-apache* about Apache file serving and configuration.
