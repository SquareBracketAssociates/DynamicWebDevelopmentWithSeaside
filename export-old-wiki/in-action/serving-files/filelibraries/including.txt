How you use a file library depends on what you want to do with the files in it. As you've seen in the previous sections, using image, music, style sheets and JavaScript files requires knowing their URL. You can find the URL of any document in your file library by sending the class ==WAFileLibrary class>>urlOf:==. For example, if you had added the file ==picture.jpg== to your library and you want to display it in a component you would write something like: ==MyClass>>renderContentOn: html==    html image url: (MyFileLibrary urlOf: #pictureJpg)The URL returned by +index:urlOf:!urlOf:+ ==urlOf:== is relative to the current server. It does not contain the *http://servername.com/* - the so-called ``method'' and ``host'' - portion of the URL. Note that WAFileLibrary implements a class method called ==/==, so the expression ==MyFileLibrary / #pictureJpeg== is equivalent to ==MyFileLibrary urlOf: #pictureJpeg==.Once you know the URL of the FileLibrary resources you can use them to include style sheets and JavaScript in your components as we have already discussed.
