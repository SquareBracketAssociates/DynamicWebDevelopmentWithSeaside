For the Sudoku model we use the ML-Sudoku package developed by Martin Laubach which is available on SqueakSource. We thank him for allowing us to use this material. To load the package, open a Monticello browser and click on the ''\+Repository'' button. Select HTTP as the type of repository and specify it as follows:==MCHttpRepository==    location: 'http://www.squeaksource.com/MLSudoku'==    user: ''==    password: ''Click on the ''Open'' button, select the most recent version and click ''Load''.ML-Sudoku is composed of 4 classes: ==MLSudoku==, ==MLBoard==, ==MLCell==, and ==MLPossibilitySet==. The class responsibilities are distributed as follows:- ==MLSudoku== is the Sudoku solver. It knows how to solve a Sudoku.- ==MLCell== knows its neighbors and their location on the game board. A cell does not know its possibility set, see ==MLPossibilitySet== below.- ==MLBoard== contains the cells and their possibility sets.- == MLPossibilitySet== is a list of possible numbers between 1 and 9 that can go into a cell. These are the values that are possible without violating the Sudoku rule that each row, column and 3-by-3 sub-grid contains each number once.
