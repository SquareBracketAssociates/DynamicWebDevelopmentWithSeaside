This short chapter explains how you can improve the quality of your code and your programming skills in general by running ''Slime'', a Seaside-specific code critics tool. For example, Slime can detect if you do not follow the canonical forms for brush usage that we presented in *ref:/book/fundamentals/rendering-components*. It will also help you identify other potential bugs early on, and help you produce better code. Furthermore, if you work on a Seaside library, it is able to point out portability issues between the different Smalltalk dialects.
