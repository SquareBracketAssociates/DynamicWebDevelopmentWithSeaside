Seaside components have the ability to specify that another component should be rendered (usually temporarily) in their place. This mechanism is triggered by the message ==call:==. During callback processing, a component may send the message ==call:== with another component as an argument. The component passed as an argument in this way can be referred to as the ''delegate''. The ==call:== method has two effects:# In subsequent rendering cycles, the delegate will be displayed in place of the original component. This continues until the delegate sends the message +index:WAComponent!answer+ ==WAComponent>>answer== to itself.# The current execution state of the calling method is suspended and does not return a value yet. Instead, Seaside renders the web page in the browser (showing the delegate in place of the original component).The delegate may be a complex component with its own control flow and state. If the delegate component later sends the message ==answer==, then execution of the (currently suspended) calling method is resumed at the site of the ==call:==. We will explain this mechanism in detail after an example. @@important From the point of view of a component, it calls another component and that component will (eventually) answer.
