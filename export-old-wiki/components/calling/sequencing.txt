As we just showed, calling is a ''modal'' interaction, that is, the method ==call:== doesn't return until the component it called answers. That allows us to sequence component display.==ContactListView>>editContact: aContact==    | view |==    view := ContactView new.==    view contact: aContact.==    self call: view.==    self inform: 'Thanks for editing  ' , aContact nameLet's suppose that you have redefined the method ==editContact:== as shown above. The method calls the view component and then, after the view answers, it displays a message. Here's something to wrap your brain around. What if the user fills in the form, presses the ''Save'' button, then presses ''Back'' and changes the values in the form and saves again? After the first save, the above method calls +index:WAComponent!inform:+ ==WAComponent>>inform:== but when the user presses ''Back'' your method backs up into the ==call:== of ==ContactView==.  What Seaside does is the following: It snapshots the state of execution of your method so that it can jump back in response to the ''Back'' button. We'll go into much more detail about this later in *ref:/book/components/calling/back-button*, For now just try it and confirm that things work as you'd expect.
