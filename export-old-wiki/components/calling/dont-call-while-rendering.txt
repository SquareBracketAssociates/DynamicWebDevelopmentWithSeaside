One of the most common mistakes for first-time Seaside developers is to send the message ==call:== a component from another component's rendering method, ==renderContentOn:==. The rendering method's purpose is ''rendering''. Its only job is to display the current state of the component. Callbacks are responsible for changing state, calling other components, etc. If you want to render one component inside another one read *ref:/book/components/embedding*.@@important Don't ==call:== a component from ==renderContentOn:==, only call components from callbacks or from ==WATask== subclasses.
