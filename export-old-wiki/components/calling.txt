Seaside applications are based on the definition and composition of components. Each component is responsible for its rendering, its state and its own control flow. Seaside lets us freely compose and ''reuse'' such components to create advanced and dynamic applications. You have already built several components. In this chapter, we will show how to reuse these components by ``calling\'' them in a modal way. Embedding components in other components will be discussed in the following chapter.
