In this chapter we have seen how to embed components to build up complex functionality. In particular, we have learned:- To embed a component in another one, the parent component should just answer the component as one of its children. Its ==children== method should return the direct children components.- Each component may render its immediate children in its own render method by calling various methods and possibly the ==render:== method.- A component may be reused with decorations. Decorations are components which add visual aspects or change component behavior.
