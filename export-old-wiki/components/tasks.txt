In Seaside, it is possible to define components whose responsibility is to represent the flow of control between existing components. These components are called ''tasks''. In this chapter, we explain how you can define a task. We also show how Seaside supports application control flow by isolating certain paths from others. We will start by presenting a little game, the number guessing game. Then, we will implement two small hotel registration applications using the calendar component to illustrate tasks.
