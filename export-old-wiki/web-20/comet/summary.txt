In this chapter we saw how we can use bleeding edge Web 2.0 technology in Seaside. The Comet technology circumvents the common restrictions of the asymmetric HTTP protocol, and allows one to change a website by initiating the update event from the server. Keep in mind that Comet is a browser hack and that you might run into scalability problems quickly. The ''Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group'' proposes a standard as part of the HTML 5 draft recommendation. Rest assured that as soon as major web browsers implement an official standard for server push, Seaside will be among the first to support the new technology.
