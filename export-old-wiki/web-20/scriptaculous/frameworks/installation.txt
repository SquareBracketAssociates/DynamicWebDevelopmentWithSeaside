As a first step we need to make sure that the Smalltalk Scriptaculous package is loaded. Most prebuilt images such as the one-click image already come with this package included. Note that despite the Scriptaculous name, the package includes the JavaScript source and integration code for both the Prototype and the script.aculo.us frameworks.  Make sure to have the packages ==Javascript-Core==, ==Prototype-Core==, ==Scriptaculous-Core== and ==Scriptaculous-Components== loaded. For examples and functional tests also load the test packages ==Javascript-Tests-Core==, ==Scriptaculous-Tests-Core== and ==Scriptaculous-Tests-Components==.
