AJAX is an acronym for ''Asynchronous JavaScript and XML''. The fact that it is asynchronous means that additional data is passed to, or requested from the web server in the background, without the user waiting for it to arrive. JavaScript obviously names the programming language that is used to trigger the request. Fortunately the data being transmitted by an AJAX request doesn't have to be in XML. It can be anything that can be sent through the HTTP protocol. The reason for the ``XML\'' in the name is that in most web browsers the internal implementation of this functionality can be found in an object called ==XMLHttpRequest==. Thankfully the Prototype framework and its integration into Seaside makes it a cakewalk to use in your applications.
