There is no point in listing all possible configuration messages that can be sent to brushes. However, both underlying JavaScript frameworks have excellent documentation that can be directly mapped to the Smalltalk world. Use the table above to find out the JavaScript class name of the item in question and look it up on either *http://www.prototypejs.org/api* or *http://wiki.github.com/madrobby/scriptaculous/*. Some of the documentation available on these sites is also part of the class and method comments in your Smalltalk image.
