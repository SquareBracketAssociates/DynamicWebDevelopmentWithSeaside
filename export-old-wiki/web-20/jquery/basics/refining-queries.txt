After you made an initial query you can refine the result with additional operations. All existing operations are described in this section:!!Siblings+index:JQueryInstance!siblings+ +index:JQueryInstance!siblings:+ Get a set of elements containing all of the unique siblings of each of the matched set of elements.==aQuery siblings.==aQuery siblings: 'div'.!!Next Siblings+index:JQueryInstance!next+ +index:JQueryInstance!next:+ Get a set of elements containing the unique next siblings of each of the given set of elements.==aQuery next.==aQuery next: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!nextAll+ +index:JQueryInstance!nextAll:+ Or, find all sibling elements after the current element.==aQuery nextAll.==aQuery nextAll: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!nextUntil:+ Or, find all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector.==aQuery nextUntil: 'div'.!!Previous Siblings+index:JQueryInstance!previous+ +index:JQueryInstance!previous:+ Get a set of elements containing the unique previous siblings of each of the matched set of elements.==aQuery previous.==aQuery previous: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!previousAll+ +index:JQueryInstance!previousAll:+ Or, find all sibling elements in front of the current element.==aQuery previousAll.==aQuery previousAll: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!previousUntil:+ Or, find all previous siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector.==aQuery previousUntil: 'div'.!!Children+index:JQueryInstance!children+ +index:JQueryInstance!children:+ Get a set of elements containing all of the unique immediate children of each of the matched set of elements.==aQuery children.==aQuery children: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!contents+ Find all the child nodes inside the matched elements (including text nodes), or the content document, if the element is an iframe.==aQuery contents.+index:JQueryInstance!find:+ Searches for all elements that match the specified expression.==aQuery find: 'div'.!! Parents+index:JQueryInstance!parent+ +index:JQueryInstance!parent:+ Get a set of elements containing the unique parents of the matched set of elements.==aQuery parent.==aQuery parent: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!parents+ +index:JQueryInstance!parents:+ Or, find all following siblings of each element up to but not including the element matched by the selector.==aQuery parents.==aQuery parents: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!parentsUntil:+ Or, find all the ancestors of each element in the current set of matched elements, up to but not including the element matched by the selector.==qQuery parentsUntil: 'div'.+index:JQueryInstance!closest+ +index:JQueryInstance!closest:+ Get a set of elements containing the closest parent element that matches the specified selector, the starting element included.==aQuery closest.==aQuery closest: 'div'.
