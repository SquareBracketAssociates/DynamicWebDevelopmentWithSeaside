jQuery is an increasingly popular Javascript library.  Let's port the the ToDo application to use jQuery for the Javascript functionality, instead of Scriptaculous.First, we'll implement the heading highlight effect with jQuery UI.  Then we'll move on to implementing a couple of interesting effects and eye-candy possible with jQuery.  Drag and drop is easy to implement, but we'll need to do something special to get the "in place" editing to work in jQuery.If you have already worked through enhancing the ToDo application with Prototype and Scriptaculous, then the jQuery version will seem very familiar - we are still working with JavaScript underneath the covers after all.
