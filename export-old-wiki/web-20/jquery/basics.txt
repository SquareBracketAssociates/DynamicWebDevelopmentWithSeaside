jQuery has a simple but powerful model for its interactions. It always follows the same pattern depicted in *ref:jquery-lifecycle*.+jquery-lifecycle|width=70%+To instantiate a ==JQueryClass== you ask a factory object for a new instance by sending the message ==jQuery==. In most cases the factory object is your ==WAHtmlCanvas==, but it can also be a ==JSScript==.==html jQueryWhile the ==JQueryClass== is conceptually a Javascript class, it is implemented as a Smalltalk instance. ==html jQuery== returns an instance of  ==JQueryClass==.!! 1. Creating QueriesTo create a ==JQueryInstance== we specify a CSS selector that queries for certain DOM elements on the your web-page. For example, to select all HTML div tags with the CSS class ==special== one would write:==html jQuery expression: 'div.special'This expression returns a ==JQueryInstance== object that represents all HTML tags matching the given CSS query ==div.special==. There is also a slightly shorter form that does exactly the same:==html jQuery: 'div.special'You find more details on creating queries in *ref:creating-queries*.!! 2. Refining QueriesIf you browse the class ==JQueryInstance==, you will see that you can add more elements or filter out elements before applying the jQuery action. For example, to select the siblings of the currently selected elements you would write:==(html jQuery: 'div.special') siblingsYou find more details on refining queries in *ref:refining-queries*.!! 3. Performing ActionsOnce you have identified the elements, you can specify the actions you wish to perform. These actions can delete, move, transform, animate or change the contents of the element. For example, to remove the elements we selected earlier we write:==(html jQuery: 'div.special') siblings; removeThere are over 180 actions provided by jQuery; these can be investigated by browsing the ==JQueryInstance== class in Smalltalk, and by visiting the jQuery documentation at *http://api.jquery.com/*.You find more details on performing actions in *ref:performing-actions*.
