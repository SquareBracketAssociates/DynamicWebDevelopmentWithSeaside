In this chapter we present CSS in a nutshell and show how Seaside helps you to use CSS in your applications. The goal of the chapter is not to replace CSS tutorials, many of which can be found on the web. Rather, the goal is to establish some basic principles and show how Seaside facilitates the decoupling of information and its visual presentation in web browsers. A clear separation between the page components and their rendering is really central to Seaside. Sometimes this frustrates newcomers because Seaside does not use template mechanisms for rendering. However, the Seaside approach allows the clear separation between the responsibilities of the web designer and the web developer. The developer is not responsible for rendering and layout of the application, this is the job of the web designer.The idea behind CSS is to decouple the presentation from the document itself. The tags in a document are interpreted using a CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) which defines the layout and style of the rendered document. In the context of Seaside, the component rendering methods generate XHTML and the CSS associated with the application specifies how such components should be displayed and placed on the page.
