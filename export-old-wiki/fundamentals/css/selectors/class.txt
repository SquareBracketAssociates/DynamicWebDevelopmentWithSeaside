The class selector is by far the most often used CSS selector. It starts with a period and usually defines a visual property that can be added to XHTML tags. The following CSS fragment defines the ==center== and the ==highlight== classes.=.center { text-align: center; }=.highlight { color: yellow; }To use class selectors, simply set the +index:WAGenericTag!class:+ ==WAGenericTag>>class:== attribute of the tag you want to change. Here we associate the class selector ==.center== to a given div element and ==.highlight== to a given paragraph.==html div==    class: 'center';==    with: 'Seaside is cool'.==html paragraph==    class: 'highlight';==    with: 'Highlighted text'The generated XHTML code looks like this:=<div class="center">Seaside is cool</div>=<p class="highlight">Highlighted text</p>Multiple classes can be added to a single XHTML tag. So the following code will display a single text that is centered and highlighted:==html div==    class: 'center';==    class: 'highlight';==    with: 'Centered and Highlighted'The generated XHTML code looks like this:=<div class="center highlight">Centered and Highlighted</div>Often CSS classes are used to conditionally highlight certain elements of a page depending on the state of the application. Seaside provides the convenience method +index:WAGenericTag!class:if:+ ==WAGenericTag>>class:if:== to make this as concise as possible. The following code snippet creates ten ==div== tags and adds the CSS class ==even== only if the condition ==index even== evaluates to ==true==. This is shorter than to manually build an ==ifTrue:ifFalse:== construct.==1 to: 10 do: [ :index |==    html div==        class: 'even' if: index even;==        with: index ]
