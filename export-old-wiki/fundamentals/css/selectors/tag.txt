The tag selector applies to specific XHTML tags, as we saw in the previous examples. The selector consists simply of the tag name as it appears in the XHTML source, but without the angle brackets. The following example removes the underlining from all anchor elements and changes the base font-size of the text within the page to 20 points. The ==body== tag is one of the top-level tags automatically created by Seaside enclosing the whole page.=a { text-decoration: none; }=body { font-size: 20pt; }
