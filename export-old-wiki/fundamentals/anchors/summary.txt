In this chapter you saw callbacks, a powerful feature of Seaside. Using a callback, we can attach an action or a small program to a link or button that will be executed only when the element is activated. What is really powerful is that you can write any Smalltalk code in a callback. In the next chapter, we will continue to enhance the iAddress application to show you how to handle forms.
