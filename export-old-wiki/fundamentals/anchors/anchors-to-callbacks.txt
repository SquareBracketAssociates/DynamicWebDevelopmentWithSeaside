You can generate run-of-the-mill HTML anchors by creating an anchor brush (send +index:WAHtmlCanvas!anchor+ ==WAHtmlCanvas>>anchor== to the canvas), then configuring the anchor to be associated with a URL using +index:WAAnchorTag!url:+ ==WAAnchorTag>>url:== and specifying the text for the anchor using ==WAAnchorTag>>with:==. Here is a simple component that displays an anchor that displays a link to the Seaside web site.==WAComponent subclass: #SimpleAnchor==    instanceVariableNames: ''==    classVariableNames: ''==    poolDictionaries: ''==    category: 'SeasideBook-Anchors'==SimpleAnchor>>renderContentOn: html==    html anchor==        url: 'http://www.seaside.st';==        with: 'Seaside Website'Register this component as ``simple-anchor\'' then view the component through your browser and you should see a page similar to *ref:anchor-1*.+A simple anchor>anchor-1|width=90%+Clicking on the ''Seaside Website'' anchor will bring you to the website.
