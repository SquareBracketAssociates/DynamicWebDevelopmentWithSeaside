Seaside support is split into a number of separately loadable packages. Here are the ones that are available in GNU Smalltalk 3.0a:- Seaside-Core- Seaside-Adapters-Swazoo- Seaside-Development- Seaside-ExamplesThe Seaside package is a collective package that loads the first two.First of all, you should create a new image with the package loaded. In GNU Smalltalk, the image acts as a kind of cache and preloading the package will speed up further operation. In the remainder of this section, ==$== is used as the prompt for things you type at the shell, and ==st>== is used as the prompt for things you type for GNU Smalltalk.=$ gst=st> PackageLoader fileInPackage: 'Seaside'=st> PackageLoader fileInPackage: 'Seaside-Development'=st> PackageLoader fileInPackage: 'Seaside-Examples'=st> ObjectMemory snapshot: 'seaside.im'
