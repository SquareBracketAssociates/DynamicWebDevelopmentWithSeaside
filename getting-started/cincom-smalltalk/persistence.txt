One of the strengths of VisualWorks as platform for Seaside is its strong support for relational databases commonly already installed in many environments. This provides an obvious persistence mechanism, when data being used by the Seaside application must be stored.To simplify using these databases for persistence, Seaside on VisualWorks is integrated with GLORP, a framework for mappings between objects and the RDBMS data structures. GLORP is loaded when you load Seaside-All parcel. It's actually pre-loaded in the VisualWorks non-commercial image.GLORP is a project of Camp Smalltalk. Information about the project, including current documentation, is available at *http://glorp.org*. Additional information about using GLORP in a Seaside/VisualWorks environment is available in the WebVelocity documentation, which is available by downloading that product from the Cincom Smalltalk Download site *http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/*.
