A Seaside component is defined by a subclass of ==WAComponent== class. Accordingly, to create a component, you create the corresponding class. To create the new class, with your package selected in the top-left pane of the System Browser, pick ''Class | New Class...''. Again, the package and name space are correctly filled in already, as shown in *ref:create-class*. For a class name, again enter ==WebCounter==. Change the superclass to ==WAComponent== in Seaside. You can search for it in several ways in the tool, and when selected it will show as ==Seaside.WAComponent==. As is the case with the original WACounter example, we need the one instance variable count, so enter that.+create-class|width=40%+Leave the three checkboxes selected, and click ''OK'' to create the class. Because the check boxes were all checked, an initialize method for the class and two accessor methods for counter are also created. So, we have a start on the component.
