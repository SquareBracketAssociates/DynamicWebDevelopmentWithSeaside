Interactions between the browser and Seaside are done using callbacks in the Smalltalk code, and these are entered, directly or indirectly, in the ==WAComponent>>renderContentOn:== method. In the System Browser select the method and edit it to:==WebCounter>>renderContentOn: html ==    html heading: count. ==    html anchor ==        callback: [ self increase ]; ==        with: '++'. ==    html space. ==    html anchor ==        callback: [ self decrease ]; ==        with: '--' This adds two anchors with increment (\+\+) and decrement (\--) links that call back to our increase and decrease methods. Save the method. Then go back to the web browser and refresh the page to see the change.+../rendering-behavior/counter|width=60%+Click the new links a few time to verify that it works. That's it. You developed your first Seaside component in VisualWorks.
