We want to be able to increment and decrement the counter, which  requires two methods. In the System Browser, select ''Protocol | New'' to add a method category for methods to update the value of count. Call the category updating. Then add these two methods:==WebCounter>>increase ==    self count: count + 1 ==WebCounter>>decrease ==    self count: count - 1These use the ==count:== accessor method that was generated when the class was first created.
