Because of the strong potential for class and (global) variable name collisions in large VisualWorks applications, VisualWorks has implemented name spaces, a mechanism for restricting the referential scope of such names.While advanced usage of name spaces can be quite involved and intricate, in practice can be quite simple, especially in the context of a Seaside application. Essential points are that:- The top-level name space is named Smalltalk. - All VisualWorks base Smalltalk classes and add-ons are defined in sub-namespaces of Smalltalk. - Most Seaside classes are in the name space named Seaside. Your application should, in general, be in a name space that you create for your own usage. However, for simplicity especially during early development, you can define your classes directly in the Smalltalk name space. The various examples included with Seaside are defined in their own name spaces.
