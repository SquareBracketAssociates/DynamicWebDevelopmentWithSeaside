When the Seaside support parcel is loaded into VisualWorks, a Seaside menu is added to the VisualWorks Launcher. This provides menu access to several common control operations.|{ ''Start Server'' | Starts the Seaside server; requests can now be serviced. By default the server is running on port 7777.|{ ''Stop Server'' | Stops the Seaside server; no more transactions are accepted.|{ ''Open Browser on Server'' | Opens a web browser on the first page of the running Seaside server. |{ ''Inspect Server'' | Open a VisualWorks inspector on the server.|{ ''Log to Transcript'' | Log all server events (requests received, responses sent, etc.) into the Transcript.|{ ''Debug Mode'' | Server errors will open a debugger instead of being  suppressed. This may prevent the server from being able to handle further requests, but allows you to investigate the errors on the server side. |{ ''Settings'' | Opens the Seaside Settings dialog.
