Seaside support is provided as a loadable parcel. There are actually several parcels, but most are prerequisites that are loaded automatically when you load the Seaside parcel.Launch a VisualWorks image, such as visualnc.im. Then, open the Parcel Manager, ''System | Parcel Manager'' in the launcher. Select the Web Development category, then select the Seaside-All parcel, and click the load button, see *ref:vw-load-seaside*.+vw-load-seaside|width=60%+Once the parcel loads, a Seaside menu is added to the VisualWorks Launcher. Start a server and open a browser on the server using commands in this menu, see *ref:vw-dispatcher*. By default, Seaside serves on ==localhost:7777== and the entry address is ==http://localhost:7777/seaside==. This is the default entry point, but can be changed in the Seaside Settings.+vw-dispatcher|width=60%+
