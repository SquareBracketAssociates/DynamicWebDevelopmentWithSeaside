Now we are ready to write our first Seaside component. We are going to code a simple counter. To do this we will define a component, add some state to that component, and then create a couple of methods that define how the component is rendered in the web browser. We will then register it as a Seaside application. Finally we will see how we can save our work as a ``Monticello\'' package.
