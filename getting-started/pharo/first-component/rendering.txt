Now we can focus on Seaside specific methods. We will define the method ==renderContentOn:== to display the counter as a heading. When Seaside needs to display a component in the web browser, it calls the ==renderContentOn:== method of the component, which allows the component to decide how it should be rendered.Add a new method category called ==rendering==, and add the method definition==WebCounter>>renderContentOn: html==    html heading: countWe want to display the value of the variable ==count== by using an HTML heading tag. In Seaside, rather than having to write the HTML directly, we simply send the message ==heading:== to the html object that we were given as an argument.As we will see later, when we have completed our application, this method will give us output as shown in *ref:counter-simple*.+counter-simple|width=90%+
