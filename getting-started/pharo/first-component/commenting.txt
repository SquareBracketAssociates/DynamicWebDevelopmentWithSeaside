A class comment (along with method comments) can help other developers understand a class. With your ==WebCounter== class selected, press the class comment button ''?'' in the class browser. The code pane in the browser will now show a class comment template. Delete this template and enter the comment shown in *ref:comment-complete*. Use the context menu ''Accept (s)'' item to save your comment.When you're studying a Smalltalk framework, class comments are a pretty good place to start reading. Classes that don't have them require a lot more developer effort to figure out so get in the habit of adding these comments to all of your classes.+comment-complete|width=90%+
