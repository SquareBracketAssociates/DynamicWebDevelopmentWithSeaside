In this chapter we will show you how to get started with Seaside using the Seaside ``One Click Image\''. Within 15 minutes, you will install and launch Seaside, interact with a Smalltalk IDE and write a simple Seaside counter application. You will follow the entire procedure of creating a Seaside application. This process will highlight some of the features of Seaside. If you are new to Smalltalk, we suggest you to read chapters 3, 4 and 5 of ''Pharo by Example'' which is a free and online book available from *www.pharobyexample.org>http://www.pharobyexample.org/*. This will highlight some of the features of Smalltalk.As we mentioned previously, there are several implementations of Smalltalk. Some are commercial, such as VisualWorks, VA Smalltalk, Gemstone, and Dolphin. Others are open source, such as Pharo, Squeak and GNU Smalltalk; and finally, some are free but not open source, such as Smalltalk/X. Seaside is developed in Pharo, then ported to the other Smalltalks.
