@@blockquote ''by Monty Williams, GemStone Systems''In this chapter we show you how to develop a simple Seaside application in GemStone/S. There are two different ways to install and run a GemStone/S server: the GLASS Virtual Appliance (GLASS is an acronym for GemStone, Linux, Apache, Seaside, and Smalltalk) \-- a pre-built environment for running GemStone/S in VMware, and the GemStone/S Web Edition \-- a native version of GemStone/S for Linux or Mac OS X Leopard. Further information is available at *http://seaside.gemstone.com/*.The identical development process is used for both the GLASS Virtual Appliance and the native GemStone/S Web Edition. Both are available from *http://seaside.gemstone.com/downloads.html*. For most developers we recommend using the appliance, since this avoids the intricacies of system administration tasks. All GemStone/S editions which run  Seaside are fully 64-bit enabled, and require 64-bit hardware, a 64-bit operating system, and at least 1GB RAM. The GLASS Virtual Appliance will run on a 32-bit Windows OS as long as the underlying hardware supports running a VWware 64-bit guest operating system.
