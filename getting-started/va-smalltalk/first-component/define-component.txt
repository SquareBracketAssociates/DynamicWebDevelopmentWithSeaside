First we will define a new VA Smalltalk application to hold our simple counter. We create the SampleSeasideApp application using VA Smalltalk's Applications Manager.  Select ''Applications | Create | Application...'' to specify the name of the new application, see *ref:VASmalltalkApplicationManager*.+VASmalltalkApplicationManager|width=60%+You will also need to specify the prerequisite applications for your new application.  We are going to use the ==WAAdmin==' tool to manage the application, so you should specify its application (==SeasideToolsCoreApp==) as the only direct prerequisite of your new application.Now we define a new Seaside component named ==WebCounter== by defining a subclass of ==WAComponent==. You can do this by selecting ''Classes | Add | New Class...''.  Select ==WAComponent== as the superclass of your new class and select ''OK''; enter the name of your new class (==WebCounter==) and select ''OK''; finally, select ''subclass'' as the type of subclass you are creating and select ''OK''.  At this point you have created an application with 2 classes in it, ==SampleWebApp== and ==WebCounter==.Now open a browser on the ==WebCounter== class and add an instance variable that will contain the state of the counter.  The class definition should look like this:==WAComponent subclass: #WebCounter==    instanceVariableNames: 'count'==    classVariableNames: ''==    poolDictionaries: ''
