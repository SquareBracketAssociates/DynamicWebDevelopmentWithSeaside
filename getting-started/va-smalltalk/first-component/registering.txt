Now we should register the component as an application so that we can access it directly from the url path that will be associated with it. To register a component as an application, we ask the administration interface class ==WAAdmin== to do the work for us:==WAAdmin register: WebCounter asApplicationAt: 'webcounter'will register the component ==WebCounter== as the application named ==webcounter==.Note that this expression can also be added in the ==WebCounter== ''class'' method ==initialize== which is invoked when the class is loaded into memory:==WebCounter class>>initialize==    WAAdmin register: self asApplicationAt: 'webcounter'Now you can launch the application in your web browser by going to *http://localhost:8080/webcounter*, see *ref:simple-counter*.+simple-counter|width=60%+
