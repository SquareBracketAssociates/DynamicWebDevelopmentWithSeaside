Now we can add some actions by defining callbacks attached to anchors. We will explain actions in detail later in this book. A callback is a piece of code that will be executed when a link is clicked. For now this is just to give you a feel of Seaside programming. We update the ==WebCounter>>renderContentOn:== method as follows.==WebCounter>>renderContentOn: html==    html heading: count.==    html anchor ==        callback: [ self increase ];==        with: '++'.==    html space.==    html anchor==        callback: [ self decrease ];==        with: '--'After saving your changes, refresh the browser page and you will now see the increment and decrement links.  Click on the links so see that the counter get incremented or decremented, see *ref:Vast-sample-counter-with-actions*.+VAST-sample-counter-with-actions|width=60%+
