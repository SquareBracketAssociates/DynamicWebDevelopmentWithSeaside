Now we define the instance method ==renderContentOn:== to display the counter as a heading. Seaside will call such a method when it needs to display a component in the web browser. In the following method we just say that we want to display the value of the variable ==count== using a heading HTML tag.==WebCounter>>renderContentOn: html==    html heading: countAs you see, in Seaside you do not directly write HTML but rather you use a higher-level interface that models HTML.  This helps you avoid making HTML mistakes.  We will go into much more detail on this subject later in the book.
