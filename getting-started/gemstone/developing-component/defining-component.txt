There are two ways to define the new ==WebCounter== subclass of ==WAComponent==.Type the following class definition into the GemStone/S Transcript window or a GemStone workspace, then type CTL-d or use the "doit" menu item. Note that this GemStone/S class definition is slightly different than it would be in Squeak. The Squeak form works equally well, however you'll always see class definitions in the GemStone/S form when you browse the class.==WAComponent subclass: 'WebCounter'==    instVarNames: #(count)==    classVars: #()==    classInstVars: #()==    poolDictionaries: #[]==    category: 'GettingStarted'+wacomponent-subclass|width=60%+Alternatively, open a GemStone/S System Browser on the class ==WAComponent== and fill in a "subclass template" as shown in *ref:wacomponent-subclass*. To do this, click the green "Browse" button in the GemStone/S Transcript window, and type WAComponent into the popup. Left click WAComponent and then select the "subclass template" menu item. After filling in the template with the class definition above, type CTL-s or select the "accept" menu item.
