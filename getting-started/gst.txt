@@blockquote ''by Paolo Bonzini, developer of GNU Smalltalk''In this section we describe how to get started developing a Seaside application in GNU Smalltalk. We assume that you already have the 3.0a version (or a later one) of GNU Smalltalk installed. This is the latest release at the time of this writing, and the first to include support for Seaside. To download it, follow instructions at *http://smalltalk.gnu.org/download*.
