## Roadmap
The general plan of action is as follows.

All chapters have been converted to Microdown (a nice markdown used by the Pillar compilation chain).
Now here is what is left to do for a new version 

1. Update/revise the chapters to match newer versions of Seaside.

2. Add/integrate new contents as it comes.

## Important Points	

1. We should remove as many as possible points related to click here and define this protocol.

2. We should not migrate the Magritte chapter since it is in another booklet.

3. We should get a chapter on Bootstrap and MDL, probably one on WebSocket usage.

4. We should add point to Voyage, Willow...
