## Roadmap
The general plan of action is as follows.

0. Pick one Seaside image and Pharo 70.

1. Convert each chapter to Pillar format, link to figures/images.

2. Update/revise the chapters to match newer versions of Seaside.

3. Add/integrate new contents as it comes.

## Important Points	

1. We should remove as many as possible points related to click here and define this protocol.

2. We should not migrate the Magritte chapter since it is in another booklet

3. We should get a chapter on Bootstrap and MDL, probably one on WebSocket usage, many be Mustaside

4. We should add point to Voyage, Willow...
