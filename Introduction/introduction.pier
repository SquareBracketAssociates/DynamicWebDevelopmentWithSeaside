Seaside is an excellent framework for easily developing advanced and dynamic web applications. Seaside lets you create reusable components that you can freely compose using Smalltalk \-- a simple and pure object-oriented language. Seaside offers a powerful callback mechanism that lets you trigger code snippets when the users clicks on a link. With Seaside, you can debug your web application with a powerful dynamic debugger and modify the code on the fly while your server is running. This makes the development of complex dynamic applications smooth and fast. With Seaside, you have the time to focus on your design and solutions to your problems. In this chapter, we give an overview of Seaside and present some Smalltalk basics to help you to follow along with the book. In the *next chapter>../getting-started*, we will show you how ''you'' can program your first Seaside component in just 15 minutes.
