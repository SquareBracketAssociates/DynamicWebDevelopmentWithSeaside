It finishes by showing some push technology such as ''Comet'', which allows you to synchronize multiple applications.; *ref:../../advanced*: *Advanced>../../advanced*: Presents some details that you face when you configure and deploy a Seaside application. It shows how to test Seaside components, and discusses Seaside security by presenting the most common attacks and how Seaside deals with them effectively. Then, even though Seaside is not about persistency, we discuss some persistency approaches in Squeak. Finally, we present Magritte, a meta-data framework, and its Seaside integration. Magritte lets you generate forms on the fly.
